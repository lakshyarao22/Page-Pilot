🍱 Bento New Tab

Welcome to Bento — a modern, clean, and snappy version of the classic Bento-style portfolio/project showcase. Think of it as your personal digital lunchbox, but instead of sushi and dumplings, it serves up your coolest projects.

✨ Features

🎨 Aesthetic and minimal design (looks good on both dark and light themes)

⚡ Fast and responsive (yes, it looks great on mobile too!)

🖼️ Easy to customize images, links, and project cards

🛠️ Built to be used as a Chrome Extension (Publish Pending)

🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repo:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bento-rebuilt.git


Move into the project folder:

cd bento-rebuilt


Open it in your browser (if it’s static) or run your dev server depending on your setup.

🧑‍💻 Customization

Replace the images in the /assets folder with your own.

Update the index.html (or config file) to add your project links.

Change the colors, fonts, or hover effects to match your vibe.

🎉 Why This Exists?

Because I wanted a keyboad driven Minimal New tab. And was unable to find one.
